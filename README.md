Hello everyone . 
Mbpt is a android app that solves the problem of one who want to know about their personality type for free .
To install this app just download the app-debug.apk and install it. 

In this app a user can come to know about its MBPT personality type by answering only 70 questions. They have to just choose from the two options given below and the personality 
type of the user will be stored in the database.
User can access the data through anywhere and can get to know about the basic information about his/her personality type. I think this app can be useful in making people 
understand about themselves. This app can also be used during lectures to have a fun interactive session and the students can also freely check their MBPT types.

Coming to the techy part , I have used realtime firebase database to store the data type and also the account information about the user. An user can retake the test multiple time
and the data will be updated in the realtime . The calculation if the personality types are happening in the app itself and there is also a spinner to jump to the questions directly.
Minimum supported android version is android 7.0 , and also requires Internet permission.

In future I am going to implement custom spinner to indicate the questions that are not being answered or skipped , also I will add a button to go directly to a webpage that can show
the complete description about the MBPT personality types . Also I want to add support of sharing the data after every test to your friends and family members.

If you find anything worth questioning or any ideas than I am open to suggestions . Cheers !!!
